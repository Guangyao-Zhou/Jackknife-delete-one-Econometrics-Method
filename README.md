# Jackknife-delete-one Methods Using in 2SLS Regression with Weak Instruments
## Introduction
Empirical researchers sometimes employ instrumental variables to solve endogeneity problem where regressors are correlated with the regression error terms. This correlation arises from an unobserved force that influences regressors as well as the response. However, instruments cannot solve all the problems : when instruments are weakly correlated with the endogenous variable, 2SLS estimator is biased towards the OLS estimator. Paper proposes a
